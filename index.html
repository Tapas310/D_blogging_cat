        See what I did there?<br>
        Ahem, Honestly I love mice.<br>
        that's no surprise.<br>
        Now thats quite honest,<br />
        I suppose starting off this way is best.<br />
        Programming is another love for me,<br />
        even though I rather climb a tree.<br />
        Problem solving is fun and tough<br />
        basking in the sun is not enough.<br /><br>

        Ok, ok I dont always drop rhymes and poems but.. I would like to talk
        about some struggles with learning to program. Its tough! and I thought
        digging through my neighbor's garbage was hard. Nah fam.<br /><br />
        <strong>Real talk doe</strong><br />

        I am currently following App Academy's Online Software Engineering
        Program curriculum. Honestly, I love it. It's very clear, It has reading
        material, step-by-step instructions and even videos. That being said, my
        personal experience learning HTML and CSS has been good! However, my
        main challenge has been JavaScript.<br /><br />

        JS is so fun and interesting, therefore It's a shame that its been a bit
        tough for me to puzzle at times. For example, loops within functions
        featuring Arrays. It's slowly registering though, which is normal for
        some of us, so I hear. Problem solving is exactly that, it's not easy
        otherwise would it truly be a problem?

        You know, cat nip is solid. Yeah...wait what was the question?<br />
        Ah yes wins. I do have a few wins, which is good. Although sometimes I
        just simply cannot wrap my mind around something, cough cough JS cough,
        I dont give up and I eventually, find a solution.<br /><br />
        When the dust settles, I still absolutely love programming and It's only
        the beginning.
