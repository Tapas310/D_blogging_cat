Blog-type website
"D the blogging cat"
First-ish little HTML,CSS project created.

Description:

I created a very simple website from scratch with no frameworks, using HTML and CSS. It is a personal blog where I am blogging
about my experience learning how to program as I move along App Academy's software engineering program.

Of course, there is quite a bit missing and so much to refine. For example, making it mobile friendly, adding
some JS to the navbar, and the list goes on. However, im good with it now and with time I will re-vamp it
into something similiar to my actual portfolio website.

To avoid it being rather boring, I take on the point of view of a programming cat who also loves to write
poems. Cheesy? Quite ! but very fun to write and pushes me to be creative which I also enjoy.
It is very basic, but that is how we learn right?

Thank You for your time!
